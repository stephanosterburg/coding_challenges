# Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.
#
# You might wonder how we can implement a function that calls itself. The trick is that each time
# a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems. The recursion
# call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.
#
# A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:
#
# A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
# A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
# Note that there could be multiple places where the function may call itself.

# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by
# modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
