# Construct a square matrix with a size N Ã— N containing integers
# from 1 to N * N in a spiral order, starting from top-left and in
# clockwise direction.

# Example
#
# For n = 3, the output should be
#
# spiralNumbers(n) = [[1, 2, 3],
#                     [8, 9, 4],
#                     [7, 6, 5]]
