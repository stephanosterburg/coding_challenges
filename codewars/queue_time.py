# There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is
# write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to
# check out!
#
# The function has two input variables:
# * customers: an array (list in python) of positive integers representing the
#   queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of
#   time they require to check out.
# * n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
#
# The function should return an integer, the total time required.
#
# EDIT: A lot of people have been confused in the comments. To try to prevent
# any more confusion:
#
# * There is only ONE queue, and
# * The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
# * Assume that the front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the
#   array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.
# * The diagram on the wiki page I linked to at the bottom of the description
#   may be useful. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool)
#
# So, for example:
#
# queue_time([5,3,4], 1)
#   should return 12
#   because when n=1, the total time is just the sum of the times
#
# queue_time([10,2,3,3], 2)
#   should return 10
#   because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the
#   queue finish before the 1st person has finished.
#
# queue_time([2,3,10], 2)
#   should return 12
def queue_time(customers, n):
    aisles = [0] * n     # create number of aisles starting with 0

    for i in customers:  # iterate over all customers
        aisles.sort()    # sort the aisles list (low -> high)
        aisles[0] += i   # add new value to first aisle, because they are done

    return max(aisles)   # return max value from the aisles list
